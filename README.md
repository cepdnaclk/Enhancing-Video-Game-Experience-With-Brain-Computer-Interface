# e16-4yp-Enhancing Video Game Experience With Brain Computer Interface
___

One of the biggest trends in the world now is playing video games. Although visual effects in video games have advanced greatly, game play approaches have remained largely constant throughout time. For playing games, gamers continue to use a keyboard, mouse, and joysticks. Hence, Brain Computer Interface (BCI) is a fantastic approach for improving the gaming experience. Applications for BCI are widely employed in the healthcare sector as well. Wheelchair control, as an illustration, is challenging for those with physical limitations. They are able to mentally operate the wheelchair with BCI technology.

Non-invasive EEG-based Brain Computer Interface (BCI) devices have been a fascinating topic of study in numerous disciplines. Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a collaboration between a brain and a device that enables signals from the brain to direct some external activity. In BCI systems, there are two main thought patterns: motor imagery and non-motor imagery. Motor imagery is a cognitive process in which a subject imagines that he/she performs a movement without actually performing the movement and without even tensing the muscles. It is a dynamic state during which the representation of a specific motor action is internally activated without any motor output. Arithmetic computation, visual counting, auditory imagination, and inner speaking are the non-motor imagery tasks. 

In this project, a simple navigation video game application will be developed. There will be five control instructions used: Left, Right, Up, Down, and None. In this approach, inner speech commands will be used as the method to control the video game application. The inner speech , also referred to as verbal thinking, is a form of self-directed speech produced in mind. One of the main steps in this project is to acquire brain signals related to inner speech. The data acquisition technique to be used is electroencephalography (EEG) which is a non-invasive data acquisition technique. It is aimed to achieve a higher level of performance by capturing the most relevant signals with the use of eight electrodes. The signal enhancement and feature extraction will be done using signal processing techniques like signal filtering, independent component analysis (ICA), principal component analysis (PCA), wavelet transform, and fast Fourier transform (FFT). Then, signals will be classified into five categories using the artificial neural network technique as up, down, left, right, and none.
